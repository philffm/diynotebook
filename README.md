As a UX Designer, I seek meaningful, distraction-free experiences that foster good habits and respect our environment. My solution? A simple hack combining an e-reader with a notebook, creating a seamless and portable reading and journaling tool.

This project is a framework, not a polished product, encouraging DIY creativity. Join me in shaping global reading and journaling habits for a more mindful and sustainable future. Let's combat digital distraction together!

## Overview

This project aims to:

- Improve accessibility for both reading and writing on the go.
- Encourage mindful, distraction-free activities.
- Provide a portable, lightweight solution for combining an e-reader and notebook.
