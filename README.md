As a UX Designer, I often get bored by digital products that sometimes are only created to distract from the real world - or make us buy more physical products more easily.

As a designer, I want to create meaningful experiences, stimulate good habits, and act resourcefully aligned with our environment.

My issues were that I needed a better trigger to start reading and journaling - making both activities as accessible as my phone. So I combined my e-reader with a physical notebook - a one-stop shop for reading and journaling.
A super simple hack - but people kept on asking me about it - so I decided to share it with you.

This project shows that sometimes the best solution is a combination of calm technology and analog products - and that we can create them ourselves.

It is an idea, a framework - not a polished product. But the IKEA effect shows: We enjoy building things ourselves anyway. It works for me - and I hope it works for you - and maybe there is an industrial designer who wants to collaborate on a more polished version.

Let me know what you think - and shape reading and journaling habits globally - let's work against digital distraction and for a more mindful and sustainable future.

## Overview

This project aims to:

- Improve accessibility for both reading and writing on the go.
- Encourage mindful, distraction-free activities.
- Provide a portable, lightweight solution for combining an e-reader and notebook.
